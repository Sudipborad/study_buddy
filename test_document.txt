Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Neural Networks - Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
4. Deep Learning - Neural networks with multiple layers
5. Training Data - The dataset used to teach the algorithm
6. Feature Engineering - Selecting and transforming input variables

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis

Popular Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering
